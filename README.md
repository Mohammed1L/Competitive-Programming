# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to competitive programming and technical interview problems from online judges such as LeetCode.  
All solutions are written in Python and include time and space complexity comments.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to practice data structures and algorithms, improve problem-solving skills, and keep a public record of consistent practice.

## Language

- Python

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by topic under the `python` directory.


Example:
python/
arrays/
strings/
hashmaps/
two_pointers/
sliding_window/
stack/
dp/
graphs/

Each solution file contains:
- Problem name and link
- Time and space complexity
- Python implementation
